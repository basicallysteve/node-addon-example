# node-addon-example

## Description
This Project is used to show how to use C++ modules in a Node Project. Some of the reasons to use C++ modules is due to constraints made in Node or performance improvements of pre-existing modules.

## Future Features
 - Experiment with the usage of BACnet modules integrated with Node.
 - Actual tests of performance with C++ modules vs Native Node modules.
 
 ### Credits
 For some of the early examples of C++ Modules, [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@atulanand94/beginners-guide-to-writing-nodejs-addons-using-c-and-n-api-node-addon-api-9b3b718a9a7f) was used as a baseline.
